# Angular JS + CodeIgniter App

A simple listing application whose frontend is developed in **Angular JS** to demonstrate some of its powerful features like **Two-Way Data Binding**, **Dependency Injection** & **Watchers**.

The APIs for the app is implemented in the PHP **CodeIgniter** framework for rapid development.

Enhancing the performance further, I have used **Gulp** as a javascript task runner in the development environment. It concatenates and minifies JavaScript & CSS.
